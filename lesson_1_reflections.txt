How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    good,helpful but there should be some better way

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
 
 	If I am unaware of doing something wrong for a long time,then I realize this.For undoing this I need 
	all history access.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   full control ,more flexibility ,considerable size!
   personal bug

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 	becuase somethimes many files are inter connected in coding so this will be helpful while changing a single file and also look what chenges I have made to others

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will give me all the commits and git diff will allow me to get difference in between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   I can try out the previous versions and one by one I can get where the bug was introuduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for my project that I want to use in my rusume
